# stonks
## Description
I decided to try something noone else has before. I made a bot to automatically trade stonks for me using AI and machine learning.
I wouldn't believe you if you told me it's unsecure! vuln.c **![Screenshot from 2023-11-13 09-18-51](https://github.com/pixie-nukes/picoCTF/assets/94845416/50625085-a913-4302-839c-bd28cd5fccb3)**

## Approach
I connected through netcat in the terminal and found something like this:
![Screenshot from 2023-11-13 09-18-51](https://github.com/pixie-nukes/picoCTF/assets/94845416/18049b6f-1774-430d-9780-2607c2d99bc4)

I tried messing with it by `%x` 100 times. And got the output as:
> 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

It looked like hex so I copied this text and put this in an Hexadecimal Convertor like [this](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-ascii.html)
And here's the output:

I got something like this
> ocip{FTC0l_I4_t5m_ll0m_y_y3nbc7ceac6ÿ¦}
This was not in the right order, so I used an online compiler and write a code like this one to get the actual flag.

## Output
picoCTF{I_l05t_4ll_my_m0n3y_c7cb6cae}

# babygame01
## Description
Get the flag and reach the exit. Welcome to BabyGame! Navigate around the map and see what you can find! The game is available to download here. There is no source available, so you'll have to figure your way around the map.
You can connect with it using **nc saturn.picoctf.net 53593**.

## Approach
- I downloaded the game file and then connected to the [server](saturn.picoctf.net) using netcat at the given port.
- I used the `W,A,S,D` keys to navigate to `x`.
- I got `You Win!` but no flag, so I tried by copying the game file loaction and then pasting it after connecting it to the server through netcat but again go the same response (`You Win!`).
- I searched online for decompilers to decompile the `ELF 32-bit LSB Executable` file.
> I found this [decompiler](https://dogbolt.org/?id=3b1456fc-43f7-41df-ac31-a4db11e832d2) helpful to decompile the file.
- The variable **local_aa4** is responsible for then value of the flag. The value of variable must not be **0**. So we must move **0** to a place where we get the flag.
- I wandered around the map but no use, so I thought of gong out of the map so when i went out of the map upto **4** places I got the following:

- So I went to the `x` position using *W,A,S,D* commands.
- And I got the flag!

## Output
picoCTF{gamer_m0d3_enabled_e282d353}

# buffer overflow 0
## Description
Smash the stack Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer?
The program is available here. You can view source here. And connect with it using:
> nc saturn.picoctf.net 65443

## Approach

If the flag printf() resides within `sigsegv_handler()`, then I can safely assume that I must figure out how to trigger a segmentation fault.

After reading the code thoroughly I found that if i can simply overflow the input then I can get the flag.
So I tried this:

I found the Flag!
